A set of power armors made out of love of both Risk of Rain and Rimworld, balanced to be at the same tier of the vanilla marine armor.

While not completely mandatory, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=932008009]Jec'sTools[/url] is required to enable better texture masking for colors.

And of course, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1579516669]Dub's Paint Shop[/url] is required to recolor armor from the default white.

Compatible with Combat Extended 1.5,1.6,1.7 / FastTrack. [b]Select which patch to use in the mod settings[/b]

[b]In development:[/b]
-Preset colors
-Outlaw power armor (Bandit)
-Researcher armor (Artificer)
-Cargo exoskeleton (Loader)
-Legendary versions of each armor
-A better thumbnail
